# PRISM: Patient Records Integration, Scheduling, and Management

PRISM is a centralized **web-based system** developed for **BeauTox Aesthetic Clinic**, an aesthetic services provider that previously relied on a fully manual system. The clinic faced operational inefficiencies in managing patient records, scheduling appointments, and generating sales reports. With hundreds of clients and multiple treatment sessions per individual, these processes were **time-consuming and prone to errors**.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Patient Record Management** – Securely store and manage client data.  
- **Session Scheduling** – Organize and track multiple treatment sessions per patient.  
- **Appointment Reminders** – Automated notifications to reduce missed appointments.  
- **Sales Reporting** – Generate weekly and monthly sales reports automatically.  

By digitizing these processes, PRISM improves **data accuracy**, enhances **operational efficiency**, and ensures a **smoother experience** for both staff and clients.

## ⚙️ Development Approach

The system was built using the **Agile methodology**, enabling iterative development and continuous client feedback. The project spanned two academic courses:

### 📘 Software Engineering I (SE1)
- Conducted **client interviews** and gathered requirements.  
- Produced key documentation:  
  - Software Requirements Specification (SRS)  
  - Software Design Document (SDD)  
  - Software Test Plan (STP)  
- Created and validated **system design** and **UI prototypes**.  

### 💻 Software Engineering II (SE2)
- Transitioned to **system development** using Agile sprints.  
- Implemented and tested the **front-end** and **back-end**.  
- Held regular meetings with the client for feedback-driven adjustments.  
- Conducted **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** and client training.  
- Successfully deployed the system.
